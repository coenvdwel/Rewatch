# Rewatch

Awesome and minimalistic unit frames addon with clickable action bars on your party members for every HoT you got, which channels down as the HoT runs out. Can be configured to your style and can additionally show action buttons, debuff and more.

* There's a small mouse-over nudge at the bottom of the frame to move Rewatch around
* Also try;
  * All: alt-click to cleanse, shift-click to rez
  * Druid: ctrl-click to cast `Nature's Swiftness` + `Regrowth`
